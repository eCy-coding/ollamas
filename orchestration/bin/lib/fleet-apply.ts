// fleet-apply (pure) — the conductor's apply-readiness triage for the fleet's gated PROPOSAL.md files.
// IO-free → unit-tested; the CLI reads the proposals, runs `git apply --check`, and can opt-in apply one.
//
// Why: the fleet PRODUCES gated proposals (Change/Diff/Test) but nothing APPLIES them — the produce→gate→
// APPLY loop is open. Most worker diffs are ILLUSTRATIVE (no real line-numbers), so a blind apply would
// fail. This module extracts the diff, judges whether it even LOOKS applyable, and (with the CLI's dry
// `git apply --check`) classifies each proposal apply-ready vs illustrative — so the conductor applies only
// clean, correct patches, gated. No blind application of weak-model output.
//
// Risk-tier: apply-ready ≠ ship-ready. A shaped edit can still PASS the gate yet be semantically wrong (e.g.
// wrapping POST calls in a single-flight collapses distinct side-effects — tsc/tests won't catch it). So the
// batch ship auto-applies ONLY the `safe-auto` tier (purely additive edits in gate-covered TS/mjs); edits that
// modify existing logic → `review` (conductor eyeballs), and non-gate-covered targets (.sh/.md/unknown) →
// `blocked` (the gate can't verify them). Deterministic, IO-free.
